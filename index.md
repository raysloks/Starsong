# Preface
These rules are very much a work in progress, they are not ready for actual play. If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know.

## Goals
<ul>
    <li>Keep combat somewhat fast and smooth.</li>
    <li>Hit points should increase quite slowly, like 1 or 2 per level.</li>
    <li>Loss of hit points should be impactful at all levels.</li>
    <li>Characters should not be able to receive permanent penalties or die without first reaching 0 hit points.</li>
    <li>Combat should not inherently be encouraged.</li>
    <li>There should be no need to whittle down the players' resources with multiple encounters to provide challenge.</li>
    <li>Different archetypes should be affected by encounter frequency in roughly the same way.</li>
    <li>There should be a decent amount of character customization.</li>
</ul>

# Skills
When you allocate a skill point, you must first roll a d6. You can then add the point to any skill in which your current rank is lower than the result.

Additionally, each rank grants a +4 bonus to relevant tests.

# Gameplay


## Rolling Dice

### Tests

A test may use a stat; a skill; both; or neither as modifiers.

Tests are sometimes referred to as checks or saves.
