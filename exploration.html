<h1>Exploration</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Turns</h2>
<p>An exploration turn can represent different durations in different contexts but for dungeoneering purposes it is usually 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>Dungeon Turn</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Wandering monsters/random encounter</li>
    <li>Player action</li>
    <li>Quickly update records</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>If a player attempts an action where the outcome is not certain, the referee should ask the player to make a test.</p>
<p>The referee may specify any stats or skills that might apply to the test. Usually, one stat and one skill should be selected.</p>
<p>The player may then argue that another stat or skill would be more applicable in the current situation.</p>
<p>A test may in rare cases benefit from multiple skills, but never from more than one stat.</p>
<p>Note that players should never ask to make a test; the referee is almost always the one to call for a test.</p>
<p>However, if a player thinks the referee missed calling for a test, they are encouraged to speak up. This shouldn't happen too often, of course.</p>
