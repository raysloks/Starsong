<h1>Damage</h1>
<h2>Wounds</h2>
<p>If a hit inflicts damage, it may also inflict a wound. A hit can only inflict a single wound, and will inflict the most severe type of wound it is able to.</p>
<p>Below is a list of conditions that cause a hit to inflict a wound.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Condition</th><th>Wound</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than half the target's current hit points.</td><td>Minor</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than the target's current hit points.</td><td>Major</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than twice the target's current hit points.</td><td>Fatal</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties nor cause death.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties if not treated well, and may cause death if treated poorly or not at all.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds will always incur permanent penalties, and will almost always cause death.</p>
<p>Tables can be found <a href="wounds.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Nonlethal</h2>
<p>Nonlethal damage can never inflict fatal wounds and always uses the unarmed wounds table.</p>
