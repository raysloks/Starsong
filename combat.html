<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Strike</h2>
<p>Roll your weapon's damage dice. The result is capped to your Strength. Deal the final result as damage to your target.</p>

<h2>Shot</h2>
<p>Roll your weapon's damage dice, exploding. The result is capped to the weapon's damage limit. Deal the final result as damage to your target.</p>
<p>If a Shot has advantage, you may reroll each damage die once. If a Shot has disadvantage, the damage dice do not explode.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>Most movement in combat occurs through the actions Charge, Stride, and Dash.</p>

<h1>Turns</h1>
<p>At the start of a time-critical encounter, every player rolls a d20 to use as their Initiative. This value may be modified by various abilities, but it is always a value between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>Regardless, record the result as your Initiative. You could do this via sticky notes or some sort of dry-erase stuff.</p>
<p>The players begin taking turns, starting at the highest Initiative.</p>

<blockquote>TODO when you start dying or something, move Initiative to right before whosever turn it is right now. This way your allies get a whole round to save you. Grabbed from Pathfinder 2e.</blockquote>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<h2>Wounds</h2>
<p>If a hit inflicts damage, it may also inflict a wound. A hit can only inflict a single wound, and will inflict the most severe type of wound it is able to.</p>
<p>Below is a list of conditions that cause a hit to inflict a wound.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Condition</th><th>Wound</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than half the target's current hit points.</td><td>Minor</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than the target's current hit points.</td><td>Major</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Damage equal to or larger than twice the target's current hit points.</td><td>Fatal</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Minor wounds will never incur permanent penalties.</p>
<p>Major wounds may incur permanent penalties if not treated well, and may be fatal if treated poorly or not at all.</p>
<p>Fatal wounds are very often fatal, and will in most cases incur permanent penalties should death not occur.</p>
