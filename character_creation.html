<h1>Stats</h1>
<p>For your character's primary stats, roll 3d6 three times, using the middle value plus 5 as the result. You may then assign each of the results to either Strength, Agility, or Mind.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Billy rolls 3d6. The dice land on 4, 3, and 6. The middle value is 4, so Billy notes down 9 as the result.</p>
<p>He then rolls 1, 5, and 5, noting 10 as the result.</p>
<p>Then, he unfortunately rolls 3, 1, and 1, noting 6 as the result.</p>
<p>Finally, he assigns 10 to his Strength, 6 to his Agility, and 9 to his Mind.</p>
