<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>These rules are very much a work in progress, they are not ready for actual play. If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep combat somewhat fast and smooth.</li>
    <li>Keep total hit points somewhat low.</li>
    <li>Loss of hit points should be felt, but there should be no need to whittle down the players resources with multiple encounters to provide challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>
<p></p>

<h1>Character Stats</h1>
<p>While a character is so much more than just stats, they provide a good baseline.</p>
<p>For creating a character, see <a href="character_creation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Primary</h2>
<p></p>

<h4>Strength</h4>
<p>The maximum damage you can deal with a single melee attack.</p>

<h4>Agility</h4>
<p>How many paces you can move in a single turn.</p>
<p>How much damage you reduce with the Dodge reaction.</p>

<h4>Intelligence</h4>
<p>Logic, reasoning, and remembering random facts.</p>

<h4>Constitution</h4>
<p>Increases you maximum hit points.</p>

<h4>Dexterity</h4>
<p>Parrying.</p>
<p>Precise fingerwork.</p>

<h4>Wisdom</h4>
<p>Instincts, common sense, and willpower.</p>

<h4>Charisma</h4>
<p>Social skills, controlling how others see you.</p>

<h2>Secondary</h2>
<p>These stats are derived from your primary stats, your perks, and your equipment.</p>

<h4>Hit Points</h4>
<p>Your base hit point total is equal to:</p>
<p>Constitution + Level</p>

<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>Every point of Armor reduces the raw damage you take by 1.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>When you allocate a skill point, you must first roll a d6. You can then add the point to any skill in which your current rank is lower than the result.</p>
<p>If you have enough ranks in a skill, you may make relevant tests without your roll being unlucky.</p>
<p>Additionally, each rank grants a +1 bonus to relevant tests.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Rolling Dice</h2>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>Roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>A test may use a stat; a skill; both; or neither as modifiers.</p>
<p>If the result is larger than or equal to the test's Difficulty Class, you succeed at the test.</p>
<p>A test should in most cases have a DC of at least 15.</p>
<p>Tests are sometimes referred to as checks or saves.</p>

<h3>Contests</h3>
<p>Roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>Your opponent does the same.</p>
<p>Whoever has the largest result wins.</p>
<p>If both results are the same, nothing happens most of the time.</p>

<h3>Lucky and Unlucky</h3>

    <li>Gain one skill rank.</li>

    <li>Advance a career or start a new career.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Careers</h3>

<h3>Skill Ranks</h3>
<p>Allocate a skill point as you did during character creation.</p>
<p>Note that you will always be able to improve one skill.</p>

<h3>Primary Stats</h3>
<p>Select one primary stat you would like to attempt to improve. Roll a d20. If the result is higher than your current stat, you may increase the stat by 1.</p>
<p>Note that you must select which stat you are attempting to improve before rolling the die.</p>
