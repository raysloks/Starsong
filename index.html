<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>These rules are very much a work in progress, they are not ready for actual play. If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep combat somewhat fast and smooth.</li>
    <li>Hit points should increase quite slowly, like 1 or 2 per level.</li>
    <li>Loss of hit points should be impactful at all levels.</li>
    <li>Characters should not be able to receive permanent penalties or die without first reaching 0 hit points.</li>
    <li>Combat should not inherently be encouraged.</li>
    <li>There should be no need to whittle down the players' resources with multiple encounters to provide challenge.</li>
    <li>Different archetypes should be affected by encounter frequency in roughly the same way.</li>
    <li>There should be a decent amount of character customization.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Character Stats</h1>
<p>While a character is so much more than just stats, they provide a good foundation.</p>
<p>For creating a character, see <a href="character_creation.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Primary</h2>
<p></p>

<h4>Strength</h4>
<p>The maximum damage you can deal with a single melee attack.</p>
<p>How much Bulk you can carry.</p>

<h4>Agility</h4>
<p>How many paces you can move in a single turn.</p>

<h4>Mind</h4>
<p></p>

<h2>Secondary</h2>
<p>These stats are derived from your primary stats, your perks, and your equipment.</p>

<h4>Hit Points</h4>
<p>How much damage you can take before you're in danger of being injured or killed.</p>

<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>Every point of Armor reduces most damage you take by 1.</p>
<p>Armor does not reduce psychic damage and falling damage.</p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>When you allocate a skill point, you must first roll a d6. You can then add the point to any skill in which your current rank is lower than the result.</p>
<p>If you have enough ranks in a skill, you may make relevant tests without being {% include unlucky.html %}.</p>
<p>Additionally, each rank grants a +4 bonus to relevant tests.</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Rolling Dice</h2>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>Roll a d20 and add any relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>A test may use a stat; a skill; both; or neither as modifiers.</p>

<p>Tests are sometimes referred to as checks or saves.</p>
